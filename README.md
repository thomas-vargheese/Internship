Perimeter Intrusion Detection System -
I was involved in developing and implementing a Perimeter Intrusion Detection System developed
for SITAR, DRDO. This project aims to design and build a Perimeter Intrusion Detection System (PIDS) to safeguard a
defined area. The system will use components like radar and accelerometer to monitor the
perimeter and trigger alerts upon potential intrusions. Data analysis will be implemented to
Differentiate real threats from disturbances.LoRa Communication Module for Avalanche Detection SystemI was also involved in the Avalanche Detection System software testing using LoRa
communication. The system is crucial as avalanche sensors often need to be placed in hard-to-reach locations and
function for extended periods on battery power.
